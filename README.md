This Weather App was made as part of The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript Path.

Things I learned about and got to practice through this project:
-Building with external API's
-Promises/async await
-Using the Geolocation API
-Dealing with dates/times and timezones
-Practice with BEM naming/class system
-JS following the AirBnb Style Guide
-Object destructuring
-Webpack practice with asset-loaders
-Mobile-first design

Overall I like my execution of this project, however I think my JS could be cleaner and more divided, and that my design had a better rendering on Desktop.
I liked practicing the use of API's and npm modules, and I think I'll continue with the BEM naming convention, but I don't think I'll use their JS framework.
