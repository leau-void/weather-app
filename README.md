This Weather App was made as part of The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript Path.

#### What I practiced with this project

- Building with external API's
- Promises/async await
- Using the Geolocation API
- Dealing with dates/times and timezones
- Practice with BEM naming/class system
- JS following the AirBnb Style Guide
- Object destructuring
- Webpack practice with asset-loaders
- Mobile-first design

Overall I like my execution of this project, however I think my JS could be cleaner and more modularized, and that my design could have had a better rendering on Desktop.

I liked practicing the use of API's and npm modules, and I think I'll continue with the BEM naming convention, but I don't think I'll use their JS framework.

#### External APIs/modules used

- OpenWeathermap's One Call API
- OpenWeathermap's Geocoding API
- date-fns/date-fns-tz
- tz-lookup
- HTML Geolocation API
